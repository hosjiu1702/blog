On Friday, May 18, I bade farewell to my apartment and my work office to go to
San Francisco International Airport (SFO). Why? I was en route to [ICRA
2018][1], the premier conference on robotics and --- I believe --- its largest
in terms of number of papers, conference attendees, and the sheer content
offered in the form of various tutorials, workshops, and sponsor events.

For travel, I booked an Air Canada round trip from San Francisco to Vancouver to
Brisbane. Yes, I had to go *north* and then go south .... there unfortunately
weren't any direct flights from San Francisco to Brisbane during my time frame
(San Francisco to Sydney is a more popular route).  But I didn't mind, as I
could finally stop using United Airlines.

As usual, I got to the airport early, and then hiked over to the International
Terminal. At SFO, I'm most familiar with Terminal 3 (United) and the
International Terminal (for international travel) and for the latter, my
favorite place to eat is Napa Farms Market, which embodies the essence of San
Francisco cuisine. I had some excellent pork which was cut in-house, and
cauliflower rice (yeah, see what I said about SF?).

Incidentally, for Terminal 3 dining, I highly recommend *Yankee Pier* and their
fish dishes.

My original plan was to pass security at around 2:00pm (which I did), then get a
nice lunch and relax at the gate before my scheduled 4:20pm departure time.
Unfortunately, while I was eating my Napa Farms Market dish, the waterfall of
delays would begin. After three separate delays, I soon learned that my flight
to Vancouver wouldn't depart until after 7:10pm. At least, assuming there
weren't any *more* delays after that.

Ouch, apparently United isn't the only airline that's struggling to keep things
on time. Maybe it's a San Francisco issue; is there too much traffic? Or could
it be due to the airport's awkward location? It's a bit oddly situated in the
bay; it borders the *inside* of the bay, rather than the great Pacific Ocean.

The good news was twofold, though:

- I had a spare United Club pass that I could use to enter a club. Fortunately,
  it turns out that *even if you are not flying United*, you can still get
  access to the clubs with a same-day boarding pass and a club pass. I don't
  know if it helped that Air Canada is part of Star Alliance, but I'm guessing
  this would be OK even if I was flying Air Whatchamacallit.
- I had arranged for a *five hour layover* at Vancouver. My flight to Brisbane
  was scheduled to leave past 11:00pm. 

This is why I aim for layovers of 5+ hours. It gives me an enormous buffer zone
in case of any delays (and at SFO, I expect them) and I really don't want to be
late for academic conferences. Furthermore, the delays let me relax at airports
for a longer time (assuming you have access to lounges!) which means I can
string together a longer time block reading papers, reading books, and blogging,
all while "fine dining" from a graduate student's perspective.

I went to the United Club at Terminal 3 since that's the largest one, and the
lounge I'm most familiar with due to all my domestic United travels. I found a
nice place to work (more accurately, read a research paper) and enjoyed some of
the free food. I had a cappuccino, some cheese, crackers, fruit, and then
enjoyed the standard complimentary house wine.

The good news was that the flight wasn't delayed too much longer, but I'm not
sure how much a 3+ delay reflects on Air Canada. Hopefully it's a rare event. I
boarded the flight and was soon in Vancouver.

The flight itself was non-eventful and I don't remember what I did. I entered
Vancouver, and saw some impressive artwork when I arrived.

I couldn't waste too much time, though. I had to pass through immigration.
Remember, United States =/= Canada. Just be warned: if you are *arriving* at a
country from a different country, *even if it is en route to yet another
country*, you still have to go through immigration and customs *and then* the
whole security pipeline after that. Fortunately, despite how the line looks long
in the photo here, I got through it quickly. Note also the sign language
interpreter video.

I quickly hurried over to my gate and managed to get some decent snacks at one
of the few places that was open at 10:30pm. The good news is that I informed my
credit card company that I was traveling in Canada and Australia, so I could use
my Credit Card. Pro tip for anyone who is traveling! You don't want your card to
be declined in the most awkward of moments.

And then ... I boarded the *fourteen hour and a half* flight to Brisbane. Ouch!
A few things about it:

- There was free wine, so apparently the Air Canada policy is the same as United
  for long-haul international flights. I wonder, though, why they offered the
  wine an hour after we departed (which was past midnight in Vancouver and SFO
  time) when it seemed like most passengers wanted to sleep. I thought they
  would have held off providing wine until perhaps the 10-hour mark of the
  flight, but I guess not. I drank some red wine and it was OK to me, though
  another conference attendee (who I met once I arrived in Brisbane) told me she
  hated it.
- The flight offered *three* meals (!!), whereas I thought only one (or at most
  two) would be provided. That's nice of them. I had requested a "fruit plate"
  dish upon paying for the tickets a few months ago, because I do not trust meat
  on airline food. To my surprise, the airline respected the request and gave me
  two fruit plates. I would have had a third, except I declined the last one
  since I decided to try out the egg dish for the third one, but really, thank
  you Air Canada for honoring my food request! I'll remember this for the
  future.
- The guy who was in my set of three seats (sitting by the window) had an Nvidia
  backpack, so I asked him about that, and it turned out he's another conference
  attendee. I also saw a few Berkeley students who I recognized on the plane.
  I'm also pretty sure that other conference attendees could tell I was going
  because I was awkwardly dragging a bulky poster tube.
- I sat in the aisle seat. This is what you *want* for a 14.5-hour flight,
  because it makes it so much easier to leave the seat and walk around, which I
  had to do several times. *Always get aisle seats for long flights!!*
  Amazingly, as far as I could tell, the Nvidia guy sitting at the window *never
  left his seat for the entire flight*. I don't think my body could handle that.
- The flight offered the usual fare of electronic entertainment (movies, card
  games, etc.) but I mostly slept (itself an accomplishment for me!) and read
  *Enlightenment Now* --- more on the book later!

I arrived in Brisbane, then went through immigration *again*. But before that, I
passed through the following duty-free store which was rather judiciously placed
so that passengers had to pass it before getting to immigration and customs:

</p>

There is a LOT of alcohol here! I enjoy some drinks now and then, but I wonder
if society worldwide is putting way too much emphasis on booze.

Going through immigration was no problem at all. Getting my taxi driver to go to
my hotel was a different matter. We had a testy conversation when I asked him to
drive me to my hotel. I kept asking him to repeat and repeat his question since
I couldn't understand what he was saying, but then I explicitly showed him the
address which I had printed on a paper beforehand, and then he was fine. Yeah,
lesson learned --- just give them a written address and they'll be fine.
Fortunately, I made it to the hotel at 9:00am, but check-in wasn't until 2:00pm
(as expected), so I left my luggage there and decided to explore the surrounding
Brisbane area.

ICRA this year is located at [Brisbane Convention Centre][2] which is in the
[South Bank Parklands][3]. I could tell that there's a *LOT* to do. One of John
Canny's students told me a few days ago that "there isn't much to do in
Brisbane" so I had to send a friendly rebuke to him via text message.

I wandered around before finding a place to eat breakfast (in Australian time)
which was more accurately lunch for me. I had some spinach, tomatoes, poached
eggs, zucchini bread, and chai tea:

</p>

I'm not much of a poached egg person but it was great! And adding milk to the
standard hot water and tea seems like an interesting combination that I'll try
out more frequently in the future.

I took a few more pictures of the South Bank. Here's one which shows an
*artificial beach* within the park on the left, with the real river on the
right.

Here's a better view of the "beach":

</p>

There's tons of great stuff here: playgrounds, more restaurants, more extensive
beaches, some architectural and artistic pieces, and so forth. I can't take
pictures of everything, unfortunately, so please check out [the South Bank
website][4] which should make you want to start booking some flights.

Just make sure you schedule your mandatory five-hour layover if SFO is part of
your itinerary.

I wandered around a bit and found a nice place to relax:

</p>

I sat on a bench and read, *Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science,
Humanism, and Progress*. [This is Bill Gates' favorite book][5], and is close to
being one of *my* favorites as well. I'll blog about it later, but the main
theme is that, despite what we may think of from the media and what politicians
say, life *has* continued to be much better for humanity as a whole, and there
is never any better time to live in the world than today. I think my trip to
Brisbane epitomizes this:

- I can board a 14.5 hour flight to go from Canada to Vancouver and trust that
  the safety record will result in a safe landing.
- I can study robotics and AI, instead of engaging in backbreaking agriculture
  labor.
- I have the freedom to walk around safely and read books as I please, rather
  than constantly worry about warfare or repercussions for reading
  non-government sanctioned books.
- I have the ability to easily check in a hotel well in advance, to know that I
  will have a roof over my head.
- I can blog and share the news about this to friends and family around the
  world.

Pinker doesn't ignore the obvious hardships that many people face nowadays, but
he makes a strong case that we are not focusing enough on the positive trends
(e.g., decline in worldwide extreme poverty) and, *more importantly*, what we
can *learn* from them so that they *continue* rather than slide back.

I devoured *Enlightenment Now* for about an hour or two and took a break ---
it's a 500-page book filled with dense endnotes --- and toured more of the South
Bank. Overall, the place is extremely impressive and great for tourists of all
shapes and sizes. Here are some (undoubtedly imprecise and biased) tradeoffs
between this and [the Darling Harbor area that I went to for UAI 2017][6]:

- **Darling Harbor advantages**: more high-end restaurants, better cruises,
  feels cleaner and wealthier
- **South Bank advantages**: a larger variety of events (many family-friendly),
  perhaps cheaper food, better running routes

The bottom line is that both areas are great and if I had to pick any place to
visit, it would probably be the one that I haven't been to the longest.

I then went back to my hotel at around 3pm, desperate to relax and shower. The
hotel I was in, *Ibis Brisbane*, is one of the cheaper ones here, and it shows
in what it provides. The WiFi is sketchy, the electrical outlets are located in
awkward configurations, there is no moisturizing cream, only two large towels
are offered, and there is no fitness center (really?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?).

It's not as good as the hotel I stayed at in Sydney, but at least it's a
functioning hotel and I can stay here for six nights without issues.

I showered and went out to explore to get some sources of nutrition. I found a
burger place and was going to eat quickly and head back to the hotel ... when,
as luck would have it, *six other Berkeley students decided to come to the place
as soon as I was about to leave*. They generously allowed me to join their
group. It's a good thing I was wearing a "Berkeley Computer Science" jacket!

I followed them to their hotel, which was heads and shoulders better than mine.
Their place was a full studio with a balcony, and the view was great:

I stayed for a while, then walked back to my hotel. I slept early, reaping the
benefits of judiciously drinking coffee and timing meals so that I can wake up
early *and* feel refreshed for tomorrow.
