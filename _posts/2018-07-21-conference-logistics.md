I am finally [attending][3] [more][2] [conferences][3] and by now it's become
clear that I need a more formal checklist for future conferences, since there
were many things I should have done further in advance. Hopefully this checklist
will serve me well for future events.

- Start planning for travel (plane tickets, hotels, etc.) *no later than* the
  point when I know I am attending for sure.  The conferences I would attend
  mandate that someone from the author list of an accepted paper has to attend
  in order for the paper to appear in the "proceedings." It is very likely,
  though, that authors can tell if their work will be accepted *before* the
  actual decision gets sent to them 2-4 months before the conference. This is
  especially true for conferences that offer multiple rounds of reviews, since
  the scores from the first set of reviews usually remain the same even after
  rebuttals. Thus, any planning of any sort should start before the final paper
  acceptance decision.

- Email other Berkeley students or those who I know about the possibilities of
  having joint activities or a group hotel reservation. I would rather not miss
  out on any gatherings among awesome people (i.e., Berkeley students). For
  this, it's helpful to know if or when the conference offers lunches and
  dinners. If the conference is smaller or less popular among Berkeley people,
  ask the organizers to add it to [ConferenceShare][4] and search there.

- Normally, in order to get better rates, we book hotel rooms through the
  conference website, or though a related source (e.g., the "Federated AI
  Meeting" portal for ICML/IJCAI/etc.) which is *not* the official hotel
  website. *Be extremely careful*, however, if trying to upgrade or adjust the
  room. I nearly got burned by this in IJCAI because I think an external source
  canceled one of my original hotel reservations after I had upgraded the room
  by emailing the hotel directly. Lesson: always, always ask for confirmation of
  my room, and do this multiple times, spaced within a few weeks to avoid angry
  hotel receptionists.

- Regarding academic accommodation (e.g., sign language interpreter or
  captioning), first figure out what I am doing. This itself is nontrivial,
  owing to the tradeoffs among different techniques and considering the
  conference location. Then, draft a "Conference XYZ Planning Logistics for
  [Insert Dates Here]" and email the details to Berkeley's DSP. Email them
  repeatedly, every three days at minimum, demanding at minimum *a confirmation
  that they have read my email and are doing something*. I apologize in advance
  to Berkeley's DSP for clogging up their inboxes.

- If the accommodations will involve additional people attending the venue,
  which is nearly always the case, then get them in touch with the conference
  organizers so that they can get badges with name tags, and to ask about any
  potentially relevant information (e.g., space limitations in certain social
  events). 

- One thing I need to start doing is *contacting the conference venue* about the
  services they offer. For instance, many venues nowadays offer services such as
  hearing loops or captioning, which could augment or mix with those from
  Berkeley's DSP.  It's also important to get a sense of how easily the lights
  or speakers can be adjusted in rooms.  IJCAI was held at Stockholmsm√§ssan, and
  the good news is that in the main lecture hall, it was straightforward for an
  IT employee to adjust the lighting to make the sign language interpreters
  visible (the room gets dark when speakers present), and to provide them with
  special microphones.

- Attire: don't bring two business suits. One is enough, if I want to bring one
  at all. Two simply takes too much space in a small suitcase, and there's no
  way I'm risking checked-in luggage.  Always bring an equal amount of
  undershirts which double as workout clothes, and make sure the hotel I'm in
  *actually has a fitness center*! Finally, bring two pairs of shoes: one for
  walking, one for running.

I likely won't be attending conferences until the spring or summer of 2019, so
best to jot these items down before forgetting them.
