The second day started out much like the first one. I went for a run, this time
in the opposite direction as I did yesterday to explore a different part of the
bay.  I ran for a few miles, then went back to the hotel to get ready for the
conference. This time, I skipped the hotel's breakfast, since I wanted to save
money and I figured the conference would give us a heaping of food today, as
they did yesterday (I was right).

After some customary opening remarks, we had the first *plenary* talk. Just to
be clear, ICRA has two main talk styles: 

- **Plenary** talks are each one hour, held from the 9:00am to 10:00am slots on
  Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. These take place in the largest room, the
  Great Hall, and are designed to be less about the technical details and more
  about engaging everyone in the conference.

- **Keynote** talks are each a half-hour, held from 10:00am to 10:30am and then
  later from 2:00pm to 2:30pm on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. At these time
  slots, *three* keynotes are provided at any given time, so you have to pick
  which one you want to be in. These are still designed to be less technical
  than most academic talks, but more technical and specialized than the plenary
  talks.

Professor and entrepreneur Rodney Brooks was scheduled to give the first plenary
talk, and in many ways he is an ideal speaker. Brooks is widely regarded in the
field of robotics and AI, with papers galore. He's also an entrepreneur, having
founded *iRobot* and *Rethink Robotics*. [I'll refer you to his website so that
you can feel inadequate][1].

The other reason why Brooks must have been invited as a speaker is that he's a
native Australian (Peter Corke emphasized: "with an Australian passport!"), and
2018 is the first year that ICRA has been held in Australia. (Though, having
said that, I wonder why they didn't invite my advisor, John Canny, who like
Brooks is also Australian --- in fact, Canny is *also* from the Adelaide area.
Of course, with only three plenaries, it would look *too much* like "home
cooking" with two Australians speaking ...)

Brooks gave an engaging, high-level talk on some of the challenges that we face
today in robotics applied to the real world. He talked about demographics,
climate change (see next image), and issues with self-driving cars deployed to
the real world. There was also an entertaining rant about the state of modern
Human-Robot Interaction research, since we're using Amazon Mechanical Turk (ugh)
and *still* relying on dumb-ass $$p$$-values (ugh ugh).

After Brooks' talk, we had a excellent keynote on machine learning and robotics
by Toronto professor Angela Schoellig. I didn't take too many pictures for this
one since this seemed to be a different flavor of machine learning and robotics
than I'm used to, but I might investigate some of her papers later.

Then we had the "morning tea" (or more accurately: tea *and* coffee *and*
pastries *and* fruits) plus the morning poster session held simultaneously, in
the same room as the welcome reception from last night. This was the first of
*six* major poster sessions (morning and afternoon for each of Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday). It consisted of several "pods" that you can see here:

I think the arrangement seems interesting, and is different from the usual
straight aisles that we see in poster sessions. The pods make it easier to see
which papers are related to each other since all one has to do is circle the
corresponding pod. They might also be more space-efficient.

The food at the poster session was plentiful:

It again wasn't the standard kind of food you'd expect at your standard American
hotel, reflecting both the diversity of food in Australia and also the amount of
money that ICRA has due to sponsors and high registration fees. Oh, and the
[silly surcharge for extra pages in papers][2].

Ironically, the coffee and hot water stations appeared to be frequently empty or
close to empty, prompting one of the sign language interpreters to argue that
this was the *reverse* of last night, in which we had far too easy access to
lots of *drinks*, but not much access to *food*.

Closer to noon, while the poster session was still going on --- though I think
most attendees stated to tire of walking around the pods --- the employees
brought out some lunch-style food.

All of this was happening in half of the gigantic exhibition area. The other
half had industry sponsor booths, like in the welcome reception from last night.

I took a break to relax and read a research paper since my legs were tired, but
by 2:00pm, another one of the day's highlights occurred: Professor Ken
Goldberg's keynote talk on *grasping* and *experiment reproducibility*:

It was a terrific talk, and I hope that people will also start putting failure
cases in papers. I will remember this, though I think I am only brave enough to
put failure cases in appendices, and not the main page-constrained portion of my
papers.

After Ken's talk, there was *another* poster session with *even more food*, but
frankly, I was so full and a bit weary of constantly walking around, so I mostly
just said hi to a few people I knew and then went back to the hotel. There was a
brief Nvidia-hosted reception that I attended to get some free food and wine,
but I did not stay very long since I did not know anyone else.

Before going to sleep, I handled some administration with my schedule. I tried
to reassure the person who was handling the sign language accommodation that,
for the poster sessions, it is not necessary to have two or more interpreters
since I spend the time mostly wandering around and taking pictures of
interesting papers. It's impossible to deeply understand a paper just by reading
a poster and talking with the author, so I take pictures and *then* follow-up by
reading as needed.

I also asked her to cancel the remaining Deaf/Hearing Interpreter (DI/HI)
appointments since those were simply too difficult for me to understand and to
benefit (see my previous post for what these entail). To be fair, the other
"normal" interpreting services were not that beneficial, but I could at least
understand perhaps 10-30% of the content in "broken" fashion. But for DI/HI, I
simply don't think it's helpful to have spoken English translated to Australian
sign language, and then translated to American/English sign language. I felt bad
about canceling since it wasn't the fault of the Deaf/Hearing Interpreter team,
but at the same time I wanted to be honest about how I was feeling about the
interpreting services.
