---

I have now run in three half marathons: the Berkeley Half Marathon (November
2017), the Kaiser Permanente San Francisco Half Marathon (February 2018), and
the Oakland Half Marathon (March 2018). 

To be clear, the Kaiser Permanente San Francisco half marathon is *not* the same
as a [separate set of San Francisco races in the summers][8]. The Oakland Half
Marathon is also technically the "Kaiser Permanente [...]" but since there's
only one main set of Oakland races a year --- known as the "Running Festival"
--- we can be more lenient in our naming convention.

All these races are popular, and the routes are relatively flat and therefore
great for setting PRs. I would be happy to run any of these again. In fact, I'll
probably will, for *all* three!

In this post, I'll provide some brief comments on each of the races. Note that:

- When I list registration fees, it's not always a clear-cut comparison since
  prices jack up closer to race day. I think I managed to get an "early bird"
  deal for all these races, so hopefully the prices are somewhat comparable.
  Also, I *include* taxes in the fee I list.

- By "packet pickup" I refer to when runners pick up whatever racing material is
  needed (typically a timing chip, bib, sometimes gear as well) a day or two
  before the actual race. These pickup events also involve some deals for food
  and running equipment from race sponsors.  Below is a picture that I took of
  the Oakland package pickup:

- While I list "pros" and "cons" of the races, most are minor in the grand
  scheme of things, and this review is for those who might be picky.  I
  reiterate that I will probably run in all of these again the next time around.

OK, let's get started!


## Berkeley Half Marathon

- Website: [here][1].
- Price I paid: about $100, including a $10 bib shipping fee.

Pros:

- The race has a great "local feel" to it, with lots of Berkeley students and
  residents both running in the race or cheering us as spectators. I saw a
  number of people that I knew, mostly other student runners, and it was nice to
  say hi to them. There was also a cool drumming band which played while we were
  entering the portion of the race close to the San Francisco Bay.

- The course is mostly flat, and enters a few Berkeley neighborhoods (again, a
  great local feel to it). There's also a relatively straight section at the
  roughly 8-11 mile range by the San Francisco Bay and which lets you see the
  runners ahead of you when you're entering the portion (for extra motivation).
  [As I discussed two years ago][4], I regularly run by this area so I was used
  to the view, but I can see it being attractive for those who don't use the
  same routes.

- There are lots of pacers, for half-marathon finish times of 1:27, 1:35 (2x),
  1:45, 1:55, etc.

- The post-race food sampling selection was fantastic! There were the obligatory
  water bottles and bananas, but I also had tasty [Power Crunch protein
  bars][6], Muscle Milk (this is clearly bad for you, but never mind), pretzels,
  cookies, coffee, etc. There was also beer, but I didn't have any.

- Post-race deals are excellent. I used them to order some Power Crunch bars at
  a discount.

- The packet pickup had some decent free food samples. The race shirt is
  interesting --- it's a different style from prior years and feels somewhat odd
  but I surprisingly like it, and I'll be wearing it both to school and for when
  I run in my own time.


Cons:

- There's a $10 bib mailing fee, and I realize now that it's pointless to pay
  for it because we *also* have to pick up a timing chip during packet pickup,
  and that's when we could have gotten the bibs. Thus, there seems to be no
  advantage to paying for the bib to be mailed. Furthermore, I wish the timing
  chip were attached to the bib; we had to tie it within our shoelaces.  I think
  it's far easier to stick it on the bib.

- The starting location is a bit awkwardly placed in the center of the city,
  though to be fair, I'm not sure of a better spot. Certainly it's less
  convenient for drop-offs and Uber rides compared to, say, Golden Gate Park.

- There were seven water stops, one of which had electrolytes and GU energy
  chews. (Unfortunately, when running, I actually dropped two out of the four GU
  chews I was given ... please use the longer, thinner packages that the Oakland
  race uses!!) The other two races offered richer goodies at the aid stations so
  next time, I'll bring my own energy stuff.

- It was the most expensive of the races I've run in, though the difference
  isn't that much, especially if you avoid making the mistake of getting your
  bib mailed to you.

- The photography selection after the race is excellent, but it's expensive and
  most of it is concentrated near the end of the race when it's crowded, so most
  pictures weren't that interesting.



## Kaiser Permanente San Francisco Half Marathon

- Website: [here][2].
- Price I paid: about $80.

Upsides:

- The race route is great! I enjoyed running through Golden Gate Park and seeing
  the Japanese Tea Garden, the California Academy of Sciences, and so on.
  There's also a very long, straight section in the second half of the race
  (longer than Berkeley's!) by the ocean where you can again see the runners
  ahead of you on their way back.

- There's a great selection of post-race sampling, arguably on par with Berkeley
  though there's no beer. There were water bottles and bananas, along with CLIF
  Whey protein bars, Ocho candy, some coffee/caffeine-base drinks, etc.

- The price is the cheapest of the three, which is surprising since I figured
  things in San Francisco would be more expensive. I suspect it has to do with
  much of the race being in Golden Gate Park, and the course is set so that
  there isn't a need to close many roads. On a related note, it's also easy to
  drop off and pick up racers.

- You have to finish the race to get your shirt. Of course this is minor, but I
  believe it's not a good idea to wear the official race shirt on race day.
  Incidentally, there's no package pickup, which means we don't get free samples
  or deals, but it's probably better for me since I would have had to Uber a
  long distance to and back.  You get the bib and timing chip mailed in advance,
  and the timing chip is (thankfully) attached to the bib.


Downsides:

- No pacers. I don't normally try to stick to a pacer during my races, but I
  think they're useful.

- While there was a great selection of post-race food sampling, there was no
  beer offered, in contrast to the Berkeley and Oakland races.

- With regards to post-race photographs, my comments on this are basically
  identical to those of the Berkeley race.

- All the aid stations had electrolytes (I think Nuun) in addition to water. It
  was a bit unclear to me which cups corresponded to what beverage, though in
  retrospect I should have realized that the "blank" cups had water and cups
  with a lightning sign on them had the electrolytes. The drinks situation
  is better than the Berkeley race, but the downside is that there were no GU
  energy chews, so perhaps it's a wash with respect to the aid stations?

- It felt like there were fewer people cheering us on when we raced,
  particularly compared to the Berkeley race.

- I don't think there were as many post-race discount deals. I was hoping that
  there were some deals for the CLIF whey protein bars, which would have been
  the analogue of the Power Crunch discount for the Berkeley race. The discount
  deals also lasted only a week, compared to *two months* for Berkeley's
  post-race stuff.



## Oakland Running Festival Half Marathon

- Website: [here][3].
- Price I paid: about $90.

Upsides:

- The race started at 9:45am, whereas the Berkeley and San Francisco races each
  started at about 8:10am. While I consider myself a morning person, that's for
  *work*. If I want to set a half marathon PR, a 9:45am starting time is far
  better.

- The Oakland race easily has the best aid stations compared to the other two
  races.  Not only were there electrolytes at each station, but some also had
  bananas, GU gels, and GU chews (yes, GU has a lot of products!). Throughout
  the race I consumed two half-bananas (easy to eat since you can squeeze them),
  one GU gel, and one GU chew package, which contained about eight chews. This
  was very helpful!

- There were lots of spectators and locals cheering us on, possibly as much as
  the Berkeley race had.

- The view of Lake Merritt is excellent, and it's probably the main visual
  attraction. Other than that, the race enters the city of Oakland throughout
  mostly the business sector. Also this was the only one of the three races
  where a marathon was simultaneously offered, so there were a few marathoners
  mixed in with us.

- There's a great package pickup (which I showed a photo of earlier), which
  probably had as many deals as the Berkeley package pickup.  We had to show up
  to the pickup to get the bib and the timing chip (attached to the bib).  While
  I was there, I bought several GU products that I'll use for my future
  long-distance training sessions.

- Each runner got tickets for *two* free Lagunitas Beer cups. We had this
  offering after the race, but one was enough for me. I'm not sure how people
  can down two servings quickly.

- There were pacers for various distances.

- Race photos are *free*, which is definitely refreshing compared to the other
  two races. *Disclaimer*: I'm writing this post one day after the race
  occurred, and I won't be able to download the photos for a few days, so the
  quality may be worse on a per-photo basis.

- Unfortunately, I don't think there are *any* post-race deals. Hopefully
  something will show up in my inbox soon so I can turn this into an "upside."
  *Update 03/27/2018*: heh, a day later, I get an email in my inbox showing that
  there *are* some race deals. Excellent! The deals seems to be just as good as
  the other races, so I'll put it as an upside.


Downsides:

- The race scenery is probably less appealing than the Berkeley or San Francisco
  races. The route mostly weaves throughout the city roads, and there aren't
  clear views of the Bay. Also, the turn near the end of the race when we see
  Lake Merritt again is narrow and awkwardly placed, and it's also hilly, which
  is *not* what I want to see at the 12th and 13th mile checkpoints.

- The post-race food sampling was probably weaker compared to the other two,
  though it's debatable. There were water bottles, as you can see in my photo
  below, along with bananas and some peanut butter bars and energy drinks. I
  think the other races had more, and I was disappointed when the Oakland
  website said that racers would "receive bagels" because I didn't see any! On
  the positive side, I got a free package of [GU stroopwafel][8], so again, it's
  debatable.

- The race isn't as good at storing your sweats. At Berkeley, we could save our
  sweats in the Berkeley high school gym, and it was easy for us to retrieve our
  bags after the race. For Oakland, it was stored in a small tent and we had to
  stand in line for a while before a volunteer could find our stuff.

## Conclusion

I'm really happy that I started running half marathons. I'm signed up to run the
[San Francisco Second Half-Marathon][8] in July. If you're interested in
training with me, [let me know][5].
