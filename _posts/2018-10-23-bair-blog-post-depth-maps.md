As usual, I have been slow blogging here. This time, I have a valid excuse. I
was consumed with writing for *another* one: the Berkeley Artificial
Intelligence Research (BAIR) blog, of which I serve as the primary editorial
board member. If I may put my non-existent ego aside, the BAIR blog is more
important (and popular!)[^subscribers] than my personal blog. BAIR blog posts
generally require more effort to write than personal blog posts. Quality over
quantity, right?

You can [read my blog post there][1], which is about using depth images in the
context of deep learning and robotics. Unlike most BAIR blog posts, this one
tries to describe a little history and a unifying theme (depth images) across
multiple papers. It's a little long; we put in *a lot* of effort into this post.

I also have an [earlier BAIR blog post][2] from last year, about the work I did
with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. I've since moved on to robotics research,
which explains the sudden change in blogging topics.

Thank you for reading this little note, and I hope you also enjoy the BAIR blog
post.
