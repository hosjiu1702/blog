I spent much of the last few months preparing for the UC Berkeley EECS PhD
qualifying exams, as you might have been able to tell by the style of my recent
blogging (mostly paper notes) and my lack of blogging for the last few weeks.
The good news is that I passed the qualifying exam. [Like I did for my
prelims][2], I wrote a "transcript" of the event. I will make it public in a
future date. In this post, I discuss an interesting paper that I skimmed for my
quals but didn't have time to read in detail until after the fact: *[Algorithmic
and Human Teaching of Sequential Decision Tasks][1]*, a 2012 AAAI paper by Maya
Cakmak and Manuel Lopes.

This paper is interesting because it offers a different perspective on how to do
imitation learning. Normally, in imitation learning, there is a fixed set of
expert demonstrations $$D_{\rm expert} = \{\tau_1, \ldots, \tau_K \}$$ where
each demonstration $$\tau_i = (s_0,a_0,s_1\ldots,a_{N-1},s_N)$$ is a sequence of
states and actions. Then, a learner has to run some algorithm (classically,
either behavior cloning or inverse reinforcement learning) to train a policy
$$\pi$$ that, when executed in the same environment, is as good as the expert.

In many cases, however, it makes sense that the teacher can select the *most
informative* demonstrations for the student to learn a task. This paper thus falls
under the realm of *Active Teaching*. This is not to be confused with *Active
Learning*, as they clarify here:

This paper sets up the student to internally run inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL), and follows prior work in assuming that the value function can be written
as:

$$
\begin{align*}
V^{\pi}(s) \;&{\overset{(i)}=}\; \mathbb{E}_{\pi, s}\left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t R(s_t)\right] \\
&{\overset{(ii)}=}\; \mathbb{E}_{\pi, s}\left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t \sum_{i=1}^k w_i f_i(s_t) \right] \\
&{\overset{(iii)}=}\; \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \cdot \mathbb{E}_{\pi, s}\left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t f_i(s_t)\right] \\
&{\overset{(iv)}=}\; \bar{w}^T \bar{\mu}_{\pi,s}
\end{align*}
$$

where in (i) I applied the definition of a value function when following policy
$$\pi$$ (for notational simplicity, when I write a state under the expectation,
like $$\mathbb{E}_s$$, that means the expectation assumes we start at state
$$s$$), in (ii) I substituted the reward function by assuming it is a linear
combination of $$k$$ features, in (iii) I re-arranged, and finally in (iv) I
simplified in vector form using new notation.

We can augment the $$\bar{\mu}$$ notation to also have the initial *action* that
was chosen, as in $$s_a$$.  Then, using the fact that the IRL agent assumes
that: "if the teacher chooses action $$a$$ in state $$s$$, then $$a$$ must be at
least as good as all the other available actions in $$s$$", we have the
following set of constraints from the demonstration data $$D$$ consisting of all
trajectories:

$$\forall (s,a) \in D, \forall b, \quad \bar{w}^T(\bar{\mu}_{\pi,s_a}-\bar{\mu}_{\pi,s_b}) \ge 0 $$

The paper's main technical contribution is as follows. They argue that the above
set of (half-space) constraints results in a subspace $$c(D)$$ that contains the
true weight vector, which is equivalent to obtaining the true reward function
assuming we know the features. The weights are assumed to be bounded into some
hypercube, $$-M_w < \bar{w} < M_w$$. By sampling $$N$$ different weight vectors
$$\bar{w}_i$$ within that hypercube, they can check the percentage of sampled
weights that lie within that true subspace with this (indirect) metric:

$$G(D) = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{1}\{\bar{w}_i \in c(D)\}$$

Mathematically their problem is to find the set of demonstrations $$D$$ that
maximizes $$G(D)$$, because if that value is larger, then the sampled weights
are more likely to satisfy all the constraints, meaning that it has the property
of representing the true reward function. 

Note carefully: we're allowed to change $$D$$, the demonstration set, but we
can't change the way the weights are sampled: they have to be sampled from a
fixed hypercube.

Their algorithm is simple: do a greedy approximation. First, select a starting
state. Then, select the demonstration $$\tau_j$$ that increases the current $$G(
\{D \cup \tau_j \} )$$ value the most. Repeat until $$G(D)$$ is high enough.

For experiments, the paper relies on two sets of Grid-World mazes, shown below:

Each of these domains has three features, and furthermore, only one is "active"
at a given square in the map, so the vectors are all one-hot. Both domains have
two tasks (hence, there are four tasks total), each of which is specified by a
particular value of the feature weights. This is the same as specifying a reward
function, so the optimal path for an agent may vary.

The paper argues that their algorithm results in the most informative
demonstration in the teacher's set. For the first maze, only one demonstration
is necessary to convey each of the two tasks offered: for the second, only two
are needed for the two tasks.

That the paper's experiments involve these hand-designed mazes is probably one
of the main weaknesses. There's no way this could extend to high dimensions,
when sampling from a hypercube (even if it's "targeted" in some way, and not
sampled naively) would never result in a weight vector that satisfies all the
IRL constraints.

To conclude, this AAAI paper, though short and limited in some ways, provided me
with a new way of thinking about imitation learning with an active teacher.

Out of curiosity about follow-up, I looked at the Google Scholar of papers that
have cited this.  Some interesting ones include:

- Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning, NIPS 2016
- Showing versus Doing: Teaching by Demonstration, NIPS 2016
- Enabling Robots to Communicate Their Objectives, RSS 2017

I'm surprised, though, that one of my recent favorite papers, *[Interpretable
and Pedagogical Examples][3]*, didn't cite this one. That one is somewhat
similar to this work except it uses more sophisticated Deep Neural Networks
within an iterative training procedure, and has far more impressive experimental
results. I hope to talk about that paper in a future blog post and to
re-implement it in code.
