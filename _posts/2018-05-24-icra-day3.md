For the third day, I did my usual morning run and then went to the conference.
Today's plenary was from [DeepMind's Raia Hadsell][1].

Her talk was about *navigation*, and in the picture above you see her mention
London taxi drivers. I was aware of them after reading [Peak][2], and it was a
pleasure to see the example appear here. On the other hand, I'm not sure how
much we will be needing taxi drivers with Uber and automated cars so ... maybe
it's not good try and be a taxi driver nowadays, even in London?

Anyway, a lot of the talk was focused on the navigation parts, and the emphasis
was on real-world driving because, as Hadsell admitted, many of the examples
that DeepMind uses in their papers (particularly, the Labyrinth) are simulated.

After her talk, we had Pieter Abbeel's keynote on *Learning to Learn*. It was
similar to his other talks, with discussion on [the RL^2 algorithm][3] and his
other meta-learning papers.

The standard poster session followed Abbeel's keynote. The food for the morning
was a "vegetable bun" (some starch with veggies inside) and cupcakes.

I didn't mention this in my last post, but ICRA also contains some
*late-breaking results*, which you can see in the poster session here:

This is necessary because ICRA has such a long turnaround time compared to other
computer science conferences. The deadline for papers is September 15, with
decisions by January 15, and then the conference in May 21-25. By contrast,
ICML, NIPS, and other conferences have far faster turnaround times, so it's good
for ICRA to allocate a little space for outstanding yet recent results.

We had lunch, an afternoon keynote, another poster session, and so forth. I
found a Berkeley student who I had been wanting to talk to for a while, so that
was good. Other than that, I spent most of my time walking around, taking
pictures of interesting posters (but not really talking to anyone) and then I
sat down in a resting area and did some blogging.

Soon, the social highlight of the day would occur: the conference-sponsored,
cocktail-style dinner. (Well, actually, there were *two* dinners, this one and a
"Global Entrepreneurs" dinner held at the same time slot, but for the latter you
had to pay extra, and I'm guessing most conference attendees opted for the
dinner I went to.)

The conference dinner was at the Queensland [Gallery of Modern Art][4], built
just a few blocks away from the conference venue. I didn't know what a
"cocktail-style dinner" meant, so I was initially worried that the event was
going to be a sit-down dinner with lots of tables, and that I would be sitting
by myself or with some random strangers with foreign accents. 

My concerns were alleviated by seeing all the open space by the entrance:

I like cocktail-style dinners since it means I can move around quickly in case I
get bored or trapped in a conversation with someone who I can't understand ---
it's best to cut ties and walk away politely if it's clear that communication
will not work out.

Here was what the crowd looked like at dinner. These are pictures of the outside
areas, but there was also considerable space *inside* the building.

The lines were *very* long, and that's probably my only criticism for the night.
There were a few staff members who walked out with food for us to pick, and I
think we needed more of those. The long lines notwithstanding, the food and
drinks were *really* good, so I don't want to take too much away from the event
--- it was far more impressive than what I had imagined for a conference dinner.

I would also be remiss if I didn't mention that there was some impressive art in
the museum. (No food and drink allowed in these areas!)

I stayed for an hour and a half and then headed back to my hotel room.
