I recently attended the [27th International Joint Conference on Artificial
Intelligence (IJCAI)][1] in Stockholm, Sweden. Unlike what I did for [UAI
2017][3] and [ICRA 2018][4], I won't be able to write daily blog posts about the
conference. In part, this is because I got struck by some weird flu-like and
fever symptoms on my flight to Sweden, which sapped my energy. I thought I was
clever when my original plan was to rig my sleep schedule so that I'd skip sleep
during my last night in the United States, and then get a full 8-hours' worth of
sleep on the flight to Stockholm, upon which I'd arrive at 7:00am (in Stockholm
time) feeling refreshed. Unfortunately, my lack of sleep probably exacerbated
the unexpected illness, so that plan went out of whack.

On a more positive note, here were some of the highlights of IJCAI. I'll split
this into three main sections, followed by some concluding comments and the
photos I took.

Keynote Talks (a.k.a., "Invited Talks"):

- I enjoyed Yann LeCun's keynote on Deep Learning. Because it's Yann LeCun and
  Deep Learning.
- Jean-François Bonnefon's gave a thought-providing talk about *The Moral
  Machine Experiment*. Think of what happens with a self-driving car. Suppose
  it's in a situation when people are blocking the car's way, but it's going too
  fast to stop. Either it continues going forward (and kills the people in front
  of it) or it swerves and hits a nearby wall (and kills the passengers). What
  characteristics of the passengers or pedestrians would cause us to favor which
  of the two groups to kill?
- There was also a great talk about "Markets Without Money" by Nicole Immorlica
  of Microsoft Research. It was a high-level talk discussing some of the
  theoretical work tying together economics and computer science, about some of
  the markets we're engaged in, but which aren't money-centric. I was reminded
  of [many related books that I've been reading][6] about platforms.
- On the last day there were four invited talks: Andrew Barto for a career
  achievement award (postponed one year as he was supposed to give it last
  year), Jitendra Malik for *this year's* career achievement award, Milind Tambe
  for the John McCarthy award, and Stefano Ermon for the IJCAI Computers and
  Thought award. I enjoyed all the talks.

Workshops, Tutorials, Various Sessions, and Other Stuff:

- IJCAI had several parallel workshops and tutorials on the first three days,
  which were co-located with ICML and other AI conferences. I only attended the
  last day since I had to recover from my illness, and on that day, I attended
  tutorials about *AI and the Law* and *Predicting Human Decision-Making*. They
  were interesting, though I admit that it was hard to focus after two or three
  hours. The one on human decision-making, as I predicted, brought up Daniel
  Kahneman's 2011 magnus opus *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, [one of my favorite
  books of all time][6].
- There was a crowd-captivating robotics performance during the opening remarks
  before Yann LeCun's keynote; a mini-robot and a human actor moved alongside
  while performing a slow dance-like motion.  See my photos --- it was
  entertaining! I'm not sure how the robot was able to conduct such dexterous
  movements.
- On the penultimate day, there were back-to-back sessions about AI in Europe.
  The first featured a lively panel of seven Europeans who opinionated about
  Europe's strengths and weaknesses in AI, and what it can do in the future.
  Several common themes stood out: the need to prevent "brain drain" to the
  United States and the need for more investment in AI. Notably, the panel's
  only mention of Donald Trump was when [Max Tegmark][7] (himself one of
  Europe's "brain drains!") criticized America's leadership and called for
  Europe to resist Trump when needed. The second session was about Europe's
  current AI strategy and consisted of four consecutive talks. They were a bit
  dry and the speakers spoke with a flat tone while reading directly from text
  on the slides, so I left early to attend the student reception.
- Unique to IJCAI, it hosts a "Sister Track for Best Papers." Authors of papers
  that won some kind of award in other AI conferences are invited to speak about
  their work in IJCAI. This is actually why I was there, due to my UAI paper, so
  I'm grateful that IJCAI includes such sessions.
- IJCAI also has *early career talks*. For these, pre-tenure faculty come and
  give 25-minute talks on their research. This was the most common session I
  attended (not including keynotes), because faculty tend to be better at giving
  presentations than graduate students, who make up the bulk of the speakers in
  most sessions.

Our Social Events:

- A visit to Skansen, a large open museum, where we could see what a Swedish
  village might have looked like many years ago. It is a pleasantly surprising
  mix of a zoo, a hodgepodge of old architecture, and employees acting as
  ancient Swedish citizens. The Skansen event was joint with ICML and the other
  co-located conferences, so I saw several Berkeley people (ICML is more popular
  among us).  The food was mediocre, but this was countered by an insane amount
  of Champagne. Sadly, I was still recovering from my illness and couldn't drink
  any.
- A reception at City Hall, which is most famous for hosting the annual Nobel
  Prize ceremony.  The city of Stockholm actually *paid* for us, so it wasn't
  included as part of any IJCAI registration fees. (They must really want AI
  researchers to like Sweden!) The bad news? There were over 2000 IJCAI
  registrants, but City Hall has a strict capacity of 1200, so the only people
  who could get in were those that skipped the last session of talks that day. I
  felt this was unfair to those speakers, and I hope if similar scenarios happen
  in future iterations, IJCAI can hold a lottery and offer a second banquet for
  those who don't get in the first one.
- A conference banquet, held at the Vasa Museum near Skansen. I was excited
  about attending, but alas, it was closed to students. This was unclear from
  the conference website and program, and judging from what others said on the
  *Whova* app for the conference, I wasn't the only one confused. That this was
  not open to students caused one of the faculty attending to *boycott* the
  dinner, according to his comments on *Whova*.
- To make up for that (I suppose?), there was a student reception the next day,
  open to students only (obviously). As usual, the wine and beer was great,
  though the food itself --- served cocktail-style --- was short of what would
  qualify as a full dinner. There was a minor steak dish, along with some green
  soup for vegetarians.
- A closing reception, at the very end of the conference. It was in the
  conference venue and offered the usual wine, beer, non-alcoholic drinks, and
  some small food dishes. There wasn't much variety in the food offering.

Since I blogged about ICRA 2018 at length, I suppose it's inevitable to make
a (necessarily incomplete) comparison among the two. 

In terms of food, ICRA *completely outclasses* IJCAI. ICRA included lunch
(whereas IJCAI didn't) and the ICRA evening receptions all had far richer food
offerings than IJCAI's.  The coffee breaks for ICRA also had better food and
drink, including *free lattes* (ah, the memories...).  It looks like the higher
registration fees we pay for ICRA are reflected in the proportionately better
food and drink quality. The exception may be the alcoholic beverages; the
offerings from ICRA and IJCAI seemed to be comparable, though I'll add that I
still haven't developed the ability to tell *great* wine from *really, really
great* wine.

ICRA also has a better schedule in that poster sessions were clearly labeled in
the schedule, whereas IJCAI's weren't explicitly scheduled, meaning that it was
technically "all day". Finally, I think the venue for ICRA --- the Brisbane
Convention & Exhibition Centre --- is better designed than Stockholmsmässan, and
furthermore, there's more interesting stuff within walking distance to
Brisbane's convention. (To mitigate this, IJCAI wisely offered a public
transportation card for all attendees.)

That's not to say ICRA was superior in every metric --- far from it! The main
advantage of IJCAI is probably that we get to see more of the city itself, as I
mention in the social events above.

[Here are the photos I took while I was at IJCAI, which I've hosted in my Flickr
account][5]. (For future conferences I will probably host pictures on Flickr,
since I've used up a dangerously high amount of my memory allocation for hosting
on GitHub.) I hope you enjoy the photos!
